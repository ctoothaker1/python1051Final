Challenges: Overall, the challenges I faced while creating my game had to do with my infamiliarity with the Unity UI and C#, which was the language that 
all my scripts had to be written in. With use of a tutorial, I was able to get the gist of C# and learn the weird rules it has in comparison
to python. I honestly enjoyed using Untiy and learning a bit of C# since that was the other language I could have chosen to take this year. Getting
a glimpse into the world of Unity made me realize how easy it can be to build a decent running game, granted you have a lot of patience.
